When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
 local?

    • When you want to share with other people, so they can get easy access to
    files.
    • When you want to keep it safe in the cloud.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    The benefit is that it allows us to compare the code and be sure of any
    change we are going to push to the remote.
