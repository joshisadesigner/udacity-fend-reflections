When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
 local?

    • When you want to share with other people, so they can get easy access to
    files.
    • When you want to keep it safe in the cloud.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    The benefit is that it allows us to compare the code and be sure of any
    change we are going to push to the remote.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and
what would be harder?

    Probably Dropbox or Google Drive, what would be harder is that I don't see
    a good way to work with several developer and it will affect the code and
    files. The only thing that could be easy it that it could be share with
    people who doesn't have code knowledge.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master? What benefits does each approach have?

    When adding a new feature and for it to be reviewed before adding to the main
    code. The benefits of each approach is that it allows us to have more control
    over every feature or change added to a project.
